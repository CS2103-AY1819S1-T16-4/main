== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.planner.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the T16-4 branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1818S1-T16-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1818S1-T16-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API
in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `ModulePlannerChangedEvent` when the Module Planner data are changed,
instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results
in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect
the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model`
having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us
reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`,
`ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `FindModulePanel` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching
`.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModulePlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete c/CS1010")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Module Planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed'
e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// tag::storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `ReadOnlyModulePlanner` object in json format and read it back.

.Interactions inside the Storage component for whenever `ModulePlannerChangedEvent` is fired.
image::StorageSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.planner.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::moduleinfo[]
=== Module and Major Information

Information about modules and majors supports almost all the features in Module Planner.

Information of a module such as module code, module credit and prerequisite modules are stored in `ModuleInfo` class.
This class is made to be immutable to avoid accidental changes to the class.

A python script (link:{repoURL}/tools/moduleConverter.py[`moduleConverter.py`]) is used to download the list of NUS modules
from NUSMods server, do some data transformation and write to `data/moduleInfo.json` for the use of our app.

==== Current Implementation
===== Overview of components

Internally, `ModuleInfo` is used to hold the data for a module such as name, description, module code, prerequisites and preclusions.
`MajorDescription` is used to hold data for a major such as name, prefixes of its modules and a list of modules.



Note that corequisite relationship that descibes which modules must be taken together is not yet implemented
as it will complicate the implementation of `add` and `delete` commands.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Prerequisites and preclusions

NUSMods provides the prerequisites and preclusion of a module in normal English sentence (e.g. "CS1010 or its equivalents"
and "Departmental approval")

* **Alternative 1**: parse the sentences with natural language processing to extract the correct prerequisite and preclusion relationship of the modules
** Pros: Prerequisite and preclusion relationship of our data will be correct.
** Cons: Difficult to automate with a script due to the potential long list of exception rules.

* **Alternative 2 (Current approach)**: Extract the module codes with regular expression and assume AND relationship for prerequisites.
** Pros: Extraction can be done easily with regular expression. Prerequisite and preclusion checking is also simple to implement in Java code.
** Cons: The final data will be incorrect for rules like "(MA1101R AND MA1221) OR MA1521". How

* **Alternative 3**:

`ModuleInfoRetriever` opens the processed `data/moduleInfo.json` file packaged in the JAR file and deserialize its
content into an array of `ModuleInfo` objects. As JSON can only hold simple values such as strings and numbers,
prerequisites and preclusion are stored as an array of `String`, so we need to call `ModuleInfo.finalizeModuleInfo` to
convert the strings into `ModuleInfo`s as well before we can start querying prerequisite and preclusion from
`ModuleInfo#getPrerequisites` and `ModuleInfo#getPreclusions`.

For command implementer, you can access the complete list of `ModuleInfo` from `ModuleInfo#getModuleInfoList()`.
You can convert a module code string to a `ModuleInfo` object by passing the string to
`ModuleInfo#getFromModuleCode(String code)`.

// end::moduleinfo[]

// tag::setup[]

=== Setup feature
==== Current Implementation

The `setup` command allows users to save their major and optionally their focus areas in Module Planner.
The information is stored in `UserProfile` and is later used by `suggest` and `status` commands.

The following sequence shows the sequence when `setup` command is executed.

.Sequence Diagram for `setup` command.
image::SetupSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Argument leniency
* **Alternative 1**: Entirely reject all focus areas even if one is invalid. Focus areas must have the exact same letter casing as
listed in User Guide.
** Pros: Implementation would be simpler.
** Cons: Not user friendly. It is too easy for users to input the wrong letter casing, causing many retries.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Accept the valid focus areas even if one is invalid. Focus areas inputted is case-insensitive.
** Pros: More user friendly. User is able to update the user profile and gets positive result.
** Cons: Need to implement filtering of valid focus areas from inputted focus areas. As `f/Computer Science` and `f/cOmpUter SciEnce` are now
both valid inputs and can be inputted at the same time, we also need to filter out duplicates.

==== Aspect: Error handling
* **Alternative 1**: Check format criterias one by one and immediately throw an error in first failure.
** Pros: Implementation would be simpler. Less possible of combinations to test.
** Cons: Not user friendly. User only sees one syntax error at one time. If there are many syntax errors in user's first try, it will take
many retries for user to figure all the syntax errors.
* **Alternative 2**: Check all format criterias. If there are more than one erros, concatenate their error message before throwing exception.
** Pros: More user friendly. User will be able to see all syntax erros in first try and fix them.
** Cons: Need to create many negative test cases to test each error individually and all together. More
complicated to test the expected error messages.

// end::setup[]

=== Add feature
==== Current Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by 'ModulePlanner'. 'ModulePlanner' stores a list of all 'Semester'-s. A 'Semester' stores a list containing modules that the user has taken or is planning to take on that semester.
The implementation is as follows:

* `ModulePlanner#addModules(List<Module> modules, int index)` -- Add the list of `modules` into the semester specified by `index`.

The operation above is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addModules(List<Module> modules, int index)`

[NOTE]
A valid module is one that exists, has its module specified correctly and has not been taken or planned to take yet by the user.

Below are the possible scenarios of how it works, given a valid module `MA1521` and an invalid module `MA1234`.

===== All valid modules

The user executes `add y/1 s/1 MA1521` to add the `Module` with module code `MA1521` into year 1 semester 1 `Module` lists.
The `add` command calls `Model#addModules(...)`, which adds the module into the `Semester` with index 3.

[NOTE]
This applies to when more than one valid module is supplied.

===== All Invalid Modules
The user executes `add y/1 s/2 MA1234` command. However, since that module does not exist or is already stored in a `Semester`,
the command fails and `Model#addModules(...)` will not be called.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one invalid module is supplied.

===== Some Invalid Modules
The user executes `add y/2 s/1 MA1521 MA1234`. However, only the module `MA1521` is valid.
In this case, the command will not fail entirely and only the valid module `MA1521` will be added.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

===== No Modules
The user executes `add`. As the command has no supplied arguments, the command will fail
and the user will be informed to input arguments.

==== Design Considerations

===== Different semester start
The current implementation only assumes the user is closing into their year 1 semester 1. Further enhancement could be made by having other starting semesters

1. To mirror the real world - it is impossible for a student to void a module that has already been taken.

2. To prevent undefined behaviour - deleting a module already taken might make all future modules not yet taken to be inaccurately planned.
Also, all currently suggested modules to the user might too be inaccurate.


=== Delete feature

==== Current Implementation
===== About
The current delete mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`.
`ModulePlanner` stores a list of all the semesters the user has taken and will take.
In turn, `Semester` stores a list of the modules the user has taken, is currently taking or will be taking.

===== Process
When a module is deleted, `ModulePlanner` will go through every module added after the semester which the
module is deleted from and checks if those modules now have prerequisites that are not fulfilled. If there
are now prerequisites not fulfilled for the modules checked, they too are deleted and the process repeats for them.
For better addressing, this process will be defined as _Iterative Deletion_.

===== Input
The arguments given to the mechanism are modules, which can be a mix of valid and invalid modules.
A valid module is defined as one that has the correct module code format, is offered by the education institute
and has been taken, is currently being taken or will be taken by the user (is stored in the module planner).
An invalid module is defined as the opposite.

===== Result
Out of all these arguments, only the valid modules will be deleted from the module planner. The invalid modules
are collected and made known to the user through the Result Display. They are separated by their types:
**not offered** by the education institute and **non-existent** in the module planner. Modules with invalid module
code formats are filtered out by the `DeleteCommandParser` and hence do not appear as part of the message shown in
the `ResultDisplay`.


`ModulePlanner` uses the following operation to implement the delete mechanism:

* `ModulePlanner#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)` -- Deletes the modules from whatever semester it is in.

The above operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)`

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.
For convenience, let's define some valid modules: `CS1010`, `CS2030` and `CS2040`
and an invalid module `CS0000`. `CS1010` is a prerequisite for `CS2030` and `CS2040`.
Let's also initialise a module planner with those valid modules: +
YEAR 1 SEMESTER 1: [`CS1010`] +
YEAR 1 SEMESTER 2: [`CS2030`, `CS2040`] +
...

===== A Valid Module
The user executes `delete CS1010` command to delete the valid module `CS1010`.
The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteModules(...)`, which removes the module from the semester where it is found.
Iterative Deletion is then applied. Since `CS2030` and `CS2040` have `CS1010` as a prerequisite, if `CS1010` is
deleted, `CS2030` and `CS2040` will too be deleted.

The module planner now has this state: +
[`EMPTY`]

[NOTE]
This applies to when more than one valid module is supplied.

===== An Invalid Module
The user executes `delete CS0000` command. However, since that module is not offered by the education institute,
the command fails and `Model#deleteModules(...)` will not be called. The user will be informed of the invalid module.

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one invalid module is supplied.

===== Mix of Valid and Invalid Modules
The user executes `delete CS1010 CS0000`. However, only the module `CS1010` is valid.
In this case, `Model#deleteModules(...)` is still called, but only the valid module `CS1010` will be deleted and
Iterative Deletion applied. The user will be informed of the invalid module.

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one valid and invalid modules are supplied.

===== No Modules
The user executes `delete`. As the command has no supplied arguments, the command will fail
and the user will be informed to input arguments.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Argument leniency
* Alternative 1: Entirely reject modules even if one is invalid.
** Pros: Simple logic and requires minimal code.
** Cons: Not user friendly. The user now has to expend additional effort to edit the modules inputted.

* Alternative 2 (current choice): Accept the valid modules even if one is invalid.
** Pros: User friendly. The user gets to add in the valid modules and is notified of which modules are invalid and why.
** Cons: More complex. Requires filtering logic.

===== Aspect: Iterative Deletion
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Iterate through the modules in each semester for all years. For each semester, the modules
that do not have their prerequisite fulfilled are marked as invalid and are deleted.
** Pros: Simple logic and requires minimal code.
** Cons: Although the number of modules in the module planner is weakly limited by the education institute (students are only
   required to take about 40 modules to earn a degree), the algorithm is still relatively slow.

* Alternative 2: Construct a direct acyclic graph for all the modules in the module planner
** Pros: Fast and efficient. There is no need to iterative through several semesters to mark modules as invalid and then
   deleting them.
** Cons: More complex. Due to time constraints during the project, this approach was not taken.


=== Find feature
==== Current Implementation
===== About
The find mechanism is facilitated by the posting and handling of events. The `FindCommand#execute(...)` is the event poster
and the `MainWindow#handleFindEvent(...)` is the event handler. `find` allows the user to retrieve more information about
a specified module.

===== Input
The argument given to the mechanism is a module, which has to be offered by the education institute. If a module is not offered,
the command fails.

===== Result
The information about the module is retrieved and displayed in the Multipurpose Panel.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.

==== Module is Offered
The user executes `find c/CS1010`. The `MultiPurposePanel` displays the retrieved module information.

==== Module is Not Offered
The user executes `find c/CS0000`. The `MultiPurposePanel` does not display anything.


=== Goto feature
==== Current Implementation
===== About
The goto mechanism is facilitated by the posting and handling of events. The `GoToCommand#execute(...)` is the event poster
and the `MainWindow#handleGoToEvent(...)` is the event handler. `goto` allows the user to switch between time periods in the ui.
A time period is defined as a year-semester pair [Year, Semester].

===== Input
The argument given to the mechanism is a year-semester pair. The year has to be between 1 and 4, and the semester has to be
between 1 and 2.

===== Result
The ui switches time periods to the specified. The modules taken in the time period is displayed too.

The following sequence diagram shows how the goto operation works:

image::GoToSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.

===== Valid Year and Semester
The user executes `goto y/1 s/1`. Since both the year and semester are valid, the ui changes accordingly.

===== Invalid Year and Valid Semester
The user executes `goto y/5 s/1`. Since only the semester is valid, command fails and the ui does not change.

[NOTE]
This applies to when the year is valid but the semester is invalid.

[NOTE]
It is possible that some users take a 5th year and beyond in their education institute. However, as of now, Module Planner does not
support years beyond the 4th.


=== List feature
==== Current Implementation

The list mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`. `ModulePlanner` stores a list of all `Semester`-s and each `Semester` stores a list `modulesTaken` containing modules that the user has taken or is planning to take.
It implements the following operation:

* `ModulePlanner#listTakenModules()` -- Retrieves the list `takenModules`.
* `ModulePlanner#listTakenModulesAll()` -- Updates `takenModules` to contain a list of modules retrieved from the list `modulesTaken` in every `Semester`.
* `ModulePlanner#listTakenModulesForYear(int year)` -- Updates `takenModules` to contain a list of modules retrieved from the list `modulesTaken` in the `Semester`-s that belongs to the specified year.

The operation is exposed in `Model` interface as `Model#listTakenModules()`, `Model#listTakenModulesAll()`, and `Model#listTakenModulesForYear(int year)`.

[NOTE]
A valid index should be an integer between 0 to 7 inclusive, where index 0 represents year 1 semester 1, index 1 represents year 1 semester 2, index 2 represents year 2 semester 1, and so on.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism works.

Step 1. User launches the application. `ModulePlanner` is initialised with 8 `Semester` objects in `List<Module> semesters`.

Step 2. User executes `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1231`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1231 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 0.

Step 3. User executes `add y/2 s/1 c/CS1010`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1010 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 2.

Step 4. User wants to see the list of modules taken for year 1 by executing `list y/1`. The `list` command updates `takenModules` to contain list of modules taken in year 1 and retrieves it.
A list containing CS1231 will be displayed to the user.

Step 5. User wants to see the list of modules taken for all years by executing `list`. The `list` command updates `takenModules` to contain list of modules taken in all years and retrieves it.
A list containing CS1231 and CS1010 will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation when a valid year is specified:

image::ListSequenceDiagram_1.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation when no year is specified:

image::ListSequenceDiagram_2.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of modules is retrieved for list command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates list of modules whenever it is modified by a command (e.g. `add`) and immediately retrieves the list upon `list` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time if commands that modify the list are called frequently.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves all commands that modify list of modules without applying it and updates the list based on the commands only when it is retrieved upon `list` command.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only modifies the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as we have to store all commands that modify the list.

=== Suggest feature
==== Current Implementation

The suggest mechanism displays a list of modules available in the specified index to the user, where index represents the year and semester that the user is asking suggestions for.
It is supported by an internal list `availableModules` in `ModulePlanner`, which is regenerated after every successful execution of commands that modify `ModulePlanner` (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, etc.) and `suggest` command.
The list `availableModules` can be retrieved through `Model#getAvailableList` using `suggest` command, which takes in one argument: a valid index that corresponds to a specific year and semester.

[NOTE]
A valid index should be an integer between 0 to 7 inclusive, where index 0 represents year 1 semester 1, index 1 represents year 1 semester 2, index 2 represents year 2 semester 1, and so on.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the suggest mechanism works.

*Step 1.* User launches the application and `ModulePlanner` is initialized.

*Step 2.* User executes `suggest y/1 s/1`. The `suggest` command updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for index 0 an stores index 0 as `availableIndex` in `ModulePlanner`. It then retrieves `availableModules` and displays it to user.

*Step 3.* User executes `add y/1 s/2 c/CS1010`. The `add` command performs adding a module and updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for the stored index 0. The suggested modules list shows an updated list of available modules in year 1 semester 1 to the user.
Only `suggest` command will change the index (year and semester) to be displayed by the suggested modules list, other commands will only show an updated list for the last index displayed by `suggest`.

*Step 4.* User executes `suggest y/1 s/2`. The `suggest` command updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for index 1 an stores index 1 as `availableIndex` in `ModulePlanner`. It then retrieves `availableModules` and displays list of available modules in year 1 semester 2 to user.

Below is how the list of available modules is generated.

The method `ModulePlanner#generateAvailableModules(int index)` is called by `ModulePlanner#updateModulesAvailable`, which sets the content of `availableModules` to be the list of modules returned by `generateAvailableModules(index)`, with index being  the stored `availableIndex`.

----
private List<Module> generateAvailableModules(int index) {
    List<Module> modulesAvailable = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Module> modulesTaken = getAllModulesTaken();
    List<Module> modulesTakenBeforeIndex = getAllModulesTakenBeforeIndex(index);
    List<Module> allModules = getAllModulesFromStorage();

    for (Module m : allModules) {
        if (ModuleUtil.isModuleAvailableToTake(modulesTaken, modulesTakenBeforeIndex, m)) {
            modulesAvailable.add(m);
        }
    }

    sortAvailableModules(modulesAvailable, userProfile);

    return modulesAvailable;
}
----

The method `generateAvailableModules` retrieves all modules from the storage and performs availability checking on each of them. The available modules are put into a list which is then sorted such that core modules are put on top, followed by general education modules and unrestricted electives.
The availability checking is done by the following method.

----
public static boolean isModuleAvailableToTake(List<Module> modulesTaken, List<Module> modulesTakenBeforeIndex, Module module) {
    return hasNotTakenModule(modulesTaken, module)
            && hasFulfilledAllPrerequisites(modulesTakenBeforeIndex, module)
            && hasNotFulfilledAnyPreclusions(modulesTaken, module);
}
----

A sample scenario:
Module CS2030 has a prerequisite CS1010 and a preclusion CS1020. User has taken CS1010 in year 1 semester 2 and has not taken CS1020 or CS2030.

* Executing `suggest y/2 s/1` will display CS2030 as one of the available modules, as user has fulfilled all prerequisites of CS2030 before year 2 semester 1 and has not taken any preclusion or the module itself.
* Executing `suggest y/1 s/1` will *not* display CS2030 in the list of available modules, as user has not fulfilled all the prerequisites before year 1 semester 1 (user has only fulfilled CS1010 in the semester after).

The following sequence diagram shows how the suggest operation works:

image::SuggestSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of available modules is regenerated
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Regenerates list of available modules after every successful execution of commands that modify `ModulePlanner` and `suggest` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time because list is regenerated even if there is no change to the content.
* **Alternative 2:** Regenerates list of available module only after successful execution of commands that modify the content of the list of available modules.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only regenerates the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as we have to check whether a command modifies the list.

=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModulePlanner`.
It extends `ModulePlanner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `modulePlannerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModulePlanner#commit()` -- Saves the current module planner state in its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#undo()` -- Restores the previous module planner state from its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone module planner state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, `Model#undoModulePlanner()` and `Model#redoModulePlanner()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedModulePlanner` will be initialized with the initial module planner state,
and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single module planner state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the module planner.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, causing the modified state of the module planner
after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `modulePlannerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer`
is shifted to the newly inserted module planner state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, causing another modified module planner state
to be saved into the `modulePlannerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitModulePlanner()`,
so the module planner state will not be saved into the `modulePlannerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake,
and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoModulePlanner()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left,
pointing it to the previous module planner state, and restores the module planner to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial module planner state,
then there are no previous module planner states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoModulePlanner()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoModulePlanner()`,
which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state,
and restores the module planner to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `modulePlannerStateList.size() - 1`,
pointing to the latest module planner state, then there are no undone module planner states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoModulePlanner()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the module planner, such as `list`,
will usually not call `Model#commitModulePlanner()`, `Model#undoModulePlanner()`
or `Model#redoModulePlanner()`. Thus, the `modulePlannerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitModulePlanner()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `modulePlannerStateList`,
all module planner states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire module planner.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of module planner states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedModulePlanner`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.planner.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.planner.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.planner.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.planner.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Module Planner depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with no modules. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window..
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Double-click the jar file. This will generate some supporting files like preferences.json and config.json.
.. To simulate missing data files, remove any of the generated files. Close the window.
.. Double click the jar file again. +
   Expected: The jar file will automatically generate the relevant files removed.
   These files contain default values and not custom values set by the user.

.. To simulate corrupted data files, edit any of the generated files to break the format.
   The files are in json format and are easily editable. One example edit is to add "BobBuilder" like in the image below.
.. Expected: The jar file will automatically regenerate the corrupted files.
   These files contain default values and not custom values set by the user.
