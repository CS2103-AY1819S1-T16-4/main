== PROJECT: ModulePlanner

== Overview

This project portfolio showcases the contributions I have made in a team project under CS2103T. We developed a product called ModulePlanner on top of an existing software, AddressBook - Level 4.

ModulePlanner is a desktop application made to help NUS Computer Science undergraduate students plan their modules by giving module suggestions for every semester. It is mainly designed to be used through a Command Line Interface (CLI), although it also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

*Major Features*:
** Suggest available modules based on major requirements and module prerequisites.
** Plan modules for each semester by adding or deleting modules to or from the planner.
** Check module description, prerequisites, and preclusions.

The next few sections will describe my contributions to the project.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to suggest modules to take*
** What it does: allows the user to see the modules he/she is available to take in each semester, based on the modules he/she has taken.
** Justification: This feature helps the user plan modules by checking and listing available modules for him/her.
** Highlights: This is the main feature of our application. It demanded a careful consideration and thorough analysis of several design alternatives and implementation choices. The actual implementation was challenging as it interacted with many other components and commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the ability to list modules taken*
** What it does: allows the user to see the modules he/she has added for all years or for each year.
** Justification: This feature helps the user to quickly checks the modules he/she has added.
** Highlights: This feature interacts with other features as the list is updated with each successful execution of add or delete command.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Listing modules : `list`

If a valid year is supplied, shows a list of all modules that you have added to that year. Otherwise, shows a list of all modules that you have added to every year. +
Format: `list [y/YEAR]`

[TIP]
====
* This command is NOT undoable.
* The list of modules will be automatically updated upon adding or deleting module(s).
====

[NOTE]
====
* If no modules have been added to the specified year or no modules have been added to any year, will show an empty list.
====

Examples:

* `list y/1` +
Lists all modules taken in year 1, both semester 1 and 2 (if they exist).

* `list` +
Lists all modules taken in every year, from year 1 semester 1 to year 4 semester 2 (if they exist).

=== Getting status update : `status`

Shows how many core, unrestricted electives, and general education modules that you have taken and how many more you need to take. +
Format: `status`

=== Suggesting modules : `suggest`

If a valid year and semester are supplied, suggests a list of modules that you are available to take in the specified year and semester, based on modules that you have added. A module is available for you if:

* You have fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) all the prerequisites of the module in the semester(s) prior to the one you specified.
* You have not fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) any preclusions to the module in any semester (including semester after the one you specified).
* You have not fulfilled (added to ModulePlanner) the module in any semester (including semester after the one you specified).

The list of modules is sorted, with core modules being on top, followed by general education modules and unrestricted electives modules.

Format: `suggest y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`

[TIP]
====
* This command is NOT undoable.
* The list of suggested modules will be automatically updated upon adding or deleting module(s).
====

Examples:

* `suggest y/1 s/1`

=== List feature
==== Current Implementation

The list mechanism is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`. `ModulePlanner` stores a list of all `Semester`s and each `Semester` stores a list `modulesTaken` containing modules that the user has taken or is planning to take.
It implements the following operation:

* `ModulePlanner#getTakenModules()` -- Retrieves the list `takenModules`.
* `ModulePlanner#listTakenModulesAll()` -- Updates `takenModules` to contain a list of modules retrieved from the list `modulesTaken` in every `Semester`.
* `ModulePlanner#listTakenModulesForYear(int year)` -- Updates `takenModules` to contain a list of modules retrieved from the list `modulesTaken` in the `Semester`s that belongs to the specified year.

The operation is exposed in `Model` interface as `Model#getTakenModules()`, `Model#listTakenModulesAll()`, and `Model#listTakenModulesForYear(int year)`.

[NOTE]
A valid index should be an integer between 0 to 7 inclusive, where index 0 represents year 1 semester 1, index 1 represents year 1 semester 2, index 2 represents year 2 semester 1, and so on.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism works.

Step 1. User launches the application. `ModulePlanner` is initialised with 8 `Semester` objects in a list `semesters`.

Step 2. User executes `add y/1 s/1 c/CS1231`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1231 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 0.

Step 3. User executes `add y/2 s/1 c/CS1010`. The `add` command inserts `Module` CS1010 to the list `modulesTaken` for `Semester` object with index 2.

Step 4. User wants to see the list of modules taken for year 1 by executing `list y/1`. The `list` command updates `takenModules` to contain list of modules taken in year 1 and retrieves it.
A list containing CS1231 will be displayed to the user.

Step 5. User wants to see the list of modules taken for all years by executing `list`. The `list` command updates `takenModules` to contain list of modules taken in all years and retrieves it.
A list containing CS1231 and CS1010 will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation when a valid year is specified:

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation when no year is specified:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of modules is retrieved for list command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates list of modules whenever it is modified by a command (e.g. `add`) and immediately retrieves the list upon `list` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time if commands that modify the list are called frequently.
* **Alternative 2:** Saves all commands that modify list of modules without applying it and updates the list based on the commands only when it is retrieved upon `list` command.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only modifies the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as we have to store all commands that modify the list.

=== Suggest feature
==== Current Implementation

The suggest mechanism displays a list of modules available in the specified index to the user, where index represents the year and semester that the user is asking suggestions for.
It is supported by an internal list `availableModules` in `ModulePlanner`, which is regenerated after every successful execution of commands that modify `ModulePlanner` (`add`, `delete`, `clear`, etc.) and `suggest` command.
The list `availableModules` can be retrieved through `Model#getAvailableList()` using `suggest` command, which (`suggest` command) takes in one argument: a valid index that corresponds to a specific year and semester.

[NOTE]
A valid index should be an integer between 0 to 7 inclusive, where index 0 represents year 1 semester 1, index 1 represents year 1 semester 2, index 2 represents year 2 semester 1, and so on.

Below is an example usage scenario and how the suggest mechanism works.

*Step 1.* User launches the application and `ModulePlanner` is initialized.

*Step 2.* User executes `suggest y/1 s/1`. The `suggest` command updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for index 0 an stores index 0 as `availableIndex` in `ModulePlanner`. It then retrieves `availableModules` and displays it to user.

*Step 3.* User executes `add y/1 s/2 c/CS1010`. The `add` command performs adding a module and updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for the stored index 0. The suggested modules list shows an updated list of available modules in year 1 semester 1 to the user.
Only `suggest` command will change the index (year and semester) to be displayed by the suggested modules list, other commands will only show an updated list for the last index displayed by `suggest`.

*Step 4.* User executes `suggest y/1 s/2`. The `suggest` command updates `availableModules` to a newly generated list of available modules for index 1 an stores index 1 as `availableIndex` in `ModulePlanner`. It then retrieves `availableModules` and displays list of available modules in year 1 semester 2 to user.

Below is how the list of available modules is generated.

The method `ModulePlanner#generateAvailableModules(int index)` is called by `ModulePlanner#updateModulesAvailable()`, which sets the content of `availableModules` to be the list of modules returned by `generateAvailableModules(index)`, with `index` being the stored `availableIndex`.

----
private List<Module> generateAvailableModules(int index) {
    List<Module> modulesAvailable = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Module> modulesTaken = getAllModulesTaken();
    List<Module> modulesTakenBeforeIndex = getAllModulesTakenBeforeIndex(index);
    List<Module> allModules = getAllModulesFromStorage();

    for (Module m : allModules) {
        if (ModuleUtil.isModuleAvailable(modulesTaken, modulesTakenBeforeIndex, m)) {
            modulesAvailable.add(m);
        }
    }

    sortAvailableModules(modulesAvailable, userProfile);

    return modulesAvailable;
}
----

The method `ModulePlanner#generateAvailableModules(int index)` retrieves all modules from the storage and performs availability checking on each of them. The available modules are put into a list which is then sorted:

** in a lexicographical order if user has specified a major other than *Computer Science* through `setup` command, or
** such that core modules for *Computer Science* major are put on top, followed by general education modules and unrestricted electives.

The availability checking is done by the following method.

----
public static boolean isModuleAvailableToTake(List<Module> modulesTaken, List<Module> modulesTakenBeforeIndex, Module module) {
    return hasNotTakenModule(modulesTaken, module)
            && hasFulfilledAllPrerequisites(modulesTakenBeforeIndex, module)
            && hasNotFulfilledAnyPreclusions(modulesTaken, module);
}
----

A sample scenario:
Module CS2030 has a prerequisite CS1010 and a preclusion CS1020. User has taken CS1010 in year 1 semester 2 and has not taken CS1020 or CS2030.

* Executing `suggest y/2 s/1` will display CS2030 as one of the available modules, as user has fulfilled all prerequisites of CS2030 before year 2 semester 1 and has not taken any preclusion or the module itself.
* Executing `suggest y/1 s/1` will *not* display CS2030 in the list of available modules, as user has not fulfilled all the prerequisites before year 1 semester 1 (user has only fulfilled CS1010 in the semester after).

The following sequence diagram shows how the suggest operation works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How list of available modules is regenerated
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Regenerates list of available modules after every successful execution of commands that modify `ModulePlanner` and `suggest` command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of running time because list is regenerated even if there is no change to the content.
* **Alternative 2:** Regenerates list of available module only after successful execution of commands that modify the content of the list of available modules.
** Pros: May be more effective in terms of running time because it only regenerates the list when needed.
** Cons: Implementation will be more complicated as we have to check whether a command modifies the list.
