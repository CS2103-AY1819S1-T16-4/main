== Overview

This is a project portfolio about a team project called Module Planner when taking CS2103T,
Software Engineering.

Module Planner is a desktop module planning application to help NUS Computer Science students
figuring out what modules in order to graduate. The user interacts with it using a Command Line
Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

The main features are the adding and deleting of modules, as well as the suggesting of
new modules that the user can take based on their academic requirements.
