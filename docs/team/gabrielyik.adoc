== Project: ModulePlanner

== Overview
This is a project portfolio about a team project that I have completed recently.
The product born from this effort is called ModulePlanner.

=== About Project
ModulePlanner is an desktop application that helps Computer Science students in the
National University of Singapore to plan their modules throughout their academic journey.
It is built on top of an existing application.

It has a graphical user interface but the user interacts with it mainly through the
command line interface (keyboard only).

The main features are the adding and deleting of modules, as well as the suggesting of
new modules that the user can take based on their academic requirements.

Over the next few sections, I will describe my role and contributions to the project.

== Role
* Developer
* UI in-charge

== Summary of Contributions
=== Major Enhancement
* *Enhance Delete Command*
** The `delete` command allows the deletion of modules from ModulePlanner.
** When modules are deleted, modules that have the former as prerequisites are too deleted.
   This continues until no more modules are deleted.
** This enhanced command is better than a simple `delete` where whatever modules specified
   are deleted without any awareness of other modules that depend on them.
** The automatic removal of invalid modules in ModulePlanner assures the user that whatever
   they see in ModulePlanner is up-to-date.
** The user too does not have to manually look through modules that have their prerequisites
   violated, hence saving them time and effort.

=== Minor Enhancements
* *Setup Command*
** Co-authored the `setup` command.
** The `setup` command is run once on the first time ModulePlanner starts up. `setup` asks
   the user to their major and optional focus areas. This gives ModulePlanner the necessary
   information to tailor the modules suggested to the user.

* *Find and Goto Commands*
** The `find` command allows retrieval of module information.
** The `goto` command allows switching between the different year and semester views.

* *UI and Associated Behaviours*
** Added a column to display suggested modules and another to display
   results of the `find` and `status` commands.
** Updated the application icon to fit ModulePlanner.

=== Other Contributions
* *README*
** Updated to reflect what ModulePlanner is and how it can solve the user's problems
   in planning their modules.

* *User Guide*
** Updated with information on how to use the `delete`, `find` and `goto` commands.
** Ordered the commands list in the User Guide alphabetically (except the `help` and
   `exit` commands which are placed at the end) to make it easier for the user to find
   the command they are looking for.

* *Developer Guide*
** Updated with descriptions on how the `delete` command is implemented and why they are
   done so.
** Updated the PowerPoints of the diagrams (except for the ones on `Storage`) in the
   Developer Guide to reflect the structure and behaviour of ModulePlanner.

* *Pull Requests Reviews*
** Reviewed the pull requests of my teammates.
** Areas checked include: coding style, index errors, possible regressions to other
   components and the pros and cons of adding new classes and structure.

* *Issue Tracker*
** Added new issues that arose from offline team discussions and bug discoveries.
** Assigned teammates to the corresponding bug reports from other teams.

* *Github Releases*
** Managed the release of `v1.2` and `v1.3`

* *Report Bugs and Suggestions for Others*
** Found and reported bugs for an team.
** Suggestions were also offered.

=== Deleting modules : `delete`

Deletes the specified modules from list of current or future modules for the specified year and semester. +
Format: `delete c/MODULE_CODE...`

Examples:

* `delete c/CS1010`
* `delete c/CS1231 c/MA1521`

=== Finding information on a module : `find`

Retrieves the information of the specified module. +
Format: `find c/MODULE_CODE`

Example:

* `find c/CS1010`

=== Going to a different year and semester : `goto`

Changes the view to the specified year and semester. +
Format: `goto y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`

Example:

* `goto y/1 s/1`

=== Delete Feature
==== Current Implementation

The current delete mechanism targets valid modules and is facilitated by `ModulePlanner`.
`ModulePlanner` stores a list of all the semesters the user has taken and will take.
In turn, `Semester` stores a list of the modules the user has taken or will take.

`ModulePlanner` uses the following operation to implement the delete mechanism:

* `ModulePlanner#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)` -- Deletes the modules from whatever semester it is in.

The above operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteModules(List<Module> modules)`

[NOTE]
A valid module is one that exists, has its module code specified correctly and must have not been taken by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Below are some usage scenarios.
For convenience, let's define two modules: a valid module `MA1521` and an invalid module `MA1234`.

===== All Valid Modules
The user executes `delete MA1521` command to delete the `Module` with the module code `MA1521`.
The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteModules(...)`, which removes the module from the semester where it is found.

[NOTE]
This applies to when more than one valid module is supplied.

===== All Invalid Modules
The user executes `delete MA1234` command. However, since that module does not exist,
the command fails and `Model#deleteModules(...)` will not be called.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

[NOTE]
This applies to where more than one invalid module is supplied.

===== Some Invalid Modules
The user executes `delete MA1521 MA1234`. However, only the module `MA1521` is valid.
In this case, the command will not fail entirely and only the valid module `MA1521` will be deleted.
The user will be informed of the invalid module.

===== No Modules
The user executes `delete`. As the command has no supplied arguments, the command will fail
and the user will be informed to input arguments.

==== Design Considerations

===== Type of Modules Allowed
Only modules which the user has not taken are allowed to be deleted. There are several reasons:

1. To mirror the real world - it is impossible for a student to void a module that has already been taken.

2. To prevent undefined behaviour - deleting a module already taken might make all future modules not yet taken to be inaccurately planned.
Also, all currently suggested modules to the user might too be inaccurate.
